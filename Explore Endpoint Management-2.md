# Pillars of modern device management

- **Easy to deploy and manage**
    - When designing Operating System Deployment architecture, keeping ease of deployment and management in mind is essential. It is vital to keep a system like this simple to reduce issues when scaling upward
- **Always up to date**
    - One of the primary objectives of using MDM is to ensure that all connections are kept up to date. This allows us to keep up with emerging threats as well as increase user productivity by reducing bugs
- **Intelligent Security**
    - By connecting our device to an MDM, you gain access to a suite of security resources such as Windows Hello, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP), Windows Information Protection, Azure AD Identity Protection, Conditional Access, and more.
- **Proactive Insights**
    - Using an MDM allows for more robust information on user productivity and activity. This also allows us to take more proactive steps to discover device and app issues.

# Enterprise Desktop Life Cycle

- **Planning**
    - Preparing a strategy for system management.
        - PC Strategy
        - Demand Forecasting
        - PC Selection
        - Design configuration
- **Purchasing**
    - The procurement of devices
        - Purchase Process
        - Hardware
        - Software
        - Accessories
        - Delivery
- **Deployment**
    - The Installation of an Operating System, enrolling Devices, and deployment of applications on the system
        - Logistics
        - Software deployment
        - Configuration
        - Data migration
- **Operations**
    - Ensure that all devices are functioning correctly and are protected.
        - Facilities
        - PC Security
        - Software Updates
        - Data Protection
        - IT Admin
- **Support**
    - Ensuring end users learn how to use their systems and receive the support they need.
        - Training
        - IT support
        - Service Hardware
- **Upgrade**
    - Upgrading user workstations
        - Hardware Upgrade
        - Software Upgrade
        - PC transfer
- **Retirement**
    - The retirement of obsolete hardware
        - Replacement
        - Unenrollment from Organization

# Planning

- **PC strategy**: At this stage, we are designing policies for our devices
    - - Imaging
        - Hardware Standardization
        - Environment Design
        - Refresh Frequency
        - Laptop vs Desktop
        - BYOD
- **Computer Selection**
    - This includes the selection of hardware, Software, and peripherals.
- **Demand Forecasting**
    - We attempt to predict the company's computing resource requirements to determine the resources it needs to purchase
- **Design Configuration**
    - This process determines which new features to use and how to incorporate them into the plan.

# Purchasing

- **Hardware**
    - Hardware  typically represents half of the cost in the purchase phase of the computer life cycle
- **Software**
    - Software Includes productivity applications, antivirus Software, and communication tools
- **Perherials**
    - this includes various computer-related supplies, cables, flash drives, Power supplies, keyboards, mice, laptop bags, docking stations, and secure access cards

# Deployment

- **Developing a deployment plan**
    - Streamlining the deployment process:
    - Developing the deployment process
        - Traditional Imaging
        - Autopilot
        - Provisional Packages
    - Testing
        - With a test system, you might identify and correct errors.
    - Configuration
        - The development of an automation solution, testing, and configuring standardized images or devices configurations account for IT labor.
    - Managing the logistics
        - This includes the storage of computers, the deployment, and setting up of physical hardware, and communication. 
- **Deployment**
    - The execution of the deployment plan
- **Enrollment**
    - Enrollment is the inclusion of a device into the organization, regardless of the operating system deployment
    - This means the inclusion of Company-owned devices as well as BYOD.
    - This typically involves the installation of MDM software on all devices connected to our ecosystem
- **Data Migration** 
    - Migrate essential Data to the cloud or nonlocal solution before deployment
    - Use in-place upgrades when possible
    - Use the User State Migration Tool
